                "instance, when using a live tree), strive to wrap the light strands around the " +
                "branches, working from the inside of the tree outward, to avoid having unsightly " +
                "cords in plain sight. Also, always use a surge protector when plugging in your" +

                "\n" +
                "With the lights in place, it’s time to turn to my all-time favorite secret weapon " +

                "strips of the cellophane and tucking it into the branches of " +

                "This is particularly handy when using an artificial tree, as it " +

                " them throughout the tree with floral wire. The tree is starting to come together!\n\n" +

                "Nothing punches up a tree better than tons of terrific texture, and my favorite way " +
                "for achieving this is with picks and sprays scattered throughout the branches of the" +

                "Glass globe ornaments are the backbone of the ornament world, as they fill in space " +
                "and add sparkle, but still allow the more showy ornaments to shine. I like to" +
                " scatter 25-30 of these over the tree.\n\n" +
                "9. Prominently showcase your favorite ornaments.\n" +

                "If it’s meaningful to you, hang it. Our own family’s tree wouldn’t be complete " +
                "without the ornaments we’ve collected over the years, and the priceless " +
                "creations made by my four children year after year.\n\n" +
                "10. Go beyond the traditional tree skirt.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "It is so important to have a grounding element at the base of the tree, " +
                "not only to cover up the tree stand or base, but also to draw the eye" +
                " downward and give the tree a polished, finished look. Instead of a traditional " +
                "tree skirt, which I often find to be too small to really have the volume I want," +
                " I prefer to use a couple of yards of pretty fabric tucked loosely around the base " +
                "of the tree. This is so much less expensive, and the look of the tucks " +
